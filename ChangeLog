v0.9.5 25-NOV-1998
------------------

- WARNING :
  Due to a security hole found in Samba message command you may
  install Samba version >= 2.0 Beta 2 when using LinPopUp.

- Samba version is now checked at start up time. So, if you
  use versions 1.1X.X you will get the above message.
  (It will only be shown once)

- Added the "Host can't receive winpopup message" error 
  message that you will get when trying to send a message
  to a Linux host that doesn't use Samba or doesn't have
  the message command enabled in its smb.conf

- Yet more customization ...
  Added a "Samba Settings" tab in the preferences dialog
  box. Here you can set the username as the netbios name
  (your hostname) which will be displayed as the FROM
  part of your message. You can also indicate some
  uncomon arguments that you want to be passed to samba.
  
- A little fix made to the user's preference management
  functions to avoid to have your settings cleared when
  upgrading to a newer version of linpopup.
               
- Reseting the defaults will no more close the preferences
  dialog box.

- Color fix in preferences dialog box.

- Review the way of displaying incoming messages.
  (Message header is no more included in the text body)    

- GTK+ 1.1.x support now include accelerators.
  (new GTK+ version 1.1.5 full support)

- little code clean-up.
 
- Linpopup growed from 2408 to 2536 lines of code.


v0.9.4 04-NOV-1998
------------------

- Binaires as sources RPM (RedHat packages)
  are now available on http://www.chez.com/littleigloo

- Messages are now timestamped, 
  the date of a message is now displayed after
  the sender and sender's host information.
  NOTE: because of this the format of the
  file were messages are kept have changed.
  So old messages files are not compatible with
  the new one.

- As the messages file format have changed,
  this is the occasion to move it to a more appropriate
  location. So messages are now kept in :
  /var/lib/linpopup/messages.dat
  (old location was /tmp/linpopup.dat)

- Added "Save as" and "Save All" submenus
  in the "Message" menu. In this way a message
  or all messages can be saved in a human readable
  form ( an ASCII text file ). 

- Added support for GTK+ 1.1.x 
  Linpopup will now compile and run fine with
  GTK+ 1.1.x series. 

- The static executable included in the binairy
  distribution is now linked with GTK+ v1.0.5
  BTW, is only required to compile the sources 
  and run the dynamic executable GTK+ >=1.0.4
  
- Some fix to the minimize function. Linpopup
  will now correctly minimize when launched with
  the -min arg via .xinitrc or .Xclients.
  (will no more confuse window managers)     

- A Linpopup man page is now available.

- Made some changes to the help menu.

- Default Compilator flags are now :
  -Wall -O2 -fno-strenght-reduce
  If you want change that set CFLAGS at compile time
  i.e : make CFLAGS="-O2 -m486"  

- Updated/corrected the INSTALL file.

- Added a -info switch to make linpopup
  display some system information that
  may be useful when something goes wrong.

- Made it display a rude message when
  invoked with the -help argument.

- Fixed a little bug introduced in v0.9.3
  that resulted in a missing new line at
  the end of a the quoted part of a reply msg.

- Linpopup is now a little bit more colored.

- New changes made to the Makefile.
  

v0.9.3 20-SEPT-1998
-------------------

- MAJOR CHANGE: Message > 1600 bytes are now
  fully  supported. Possibility added to send them
  in several parts.

- MAJOR CHANGE: fixed a bug due to special
  characters in a HOSTNAME (by example JOHN'S COMPUTER
  where the ' was responsable of non delivered msg)
  (thanks to Edward Rudd)
  By the same occasion change the way to send messages
  (using now a temp file rather than a string) to
  avoid this kind of problems regarding the message text.     
      
- ABSOLUTELY No more garbage in the statusbar.
  Hope this is true this time...

- Added "Message" menu in the
  send window with submenus:
  "Load" and "send". So,it's
  now possible to load a text file
  and send it.
  
- Added "Edit" menu in the
  send window with submenus:
  "cut", "copy", "paste",
  "select all", for operations
  with the clipboard.   
  
- Due to Paul Slootman <paul@debian.org> 
  Debian package is now available.

- A little bit code Clean-Up initiated by the same Paul.
  Added some missing #INCLUDE or #DEFINE, 
  updated some comments. 
      
- Makefile clean-up/optimization done by Paul.



v0.9.2 12-SEPT-1998
-------------------

- ABSOLUTELY No more garbage in the statusbar...

- Yet more customization ...
  Added a "Messages" tab in the preferences dialog
  box. Here you can set the interval at
  which linpopup will check for new incoming 
  messages. You can even choose to never
  check for incoming messages.  

- Changed the default quote character
  from '>' to '|'. Added a possibility to
  define a personnal quote character in the
  preferences dialog box.

- Added the possibility to define a personnal
  reply header (i.e. the sentence "USER on HOST
  wrote :")     

- Quoting of a message was extended to the two
  first lines for more readibility.     

- First try to guess the deliver adress of
  a new message. Possibilities added in the 
  preferences dialog box to desactivate this, or
  to choose to always send new messages to a 
  selected host (particulary usefull if you are 
  only connected to one machine).    

- Added a "Reset Defaults" button in the preference
  dialog box.    

- Minor fix to the minimize function. Linpopup
  will now iconify itself if launched with the
  -min argument and if there is no new message.   



v0.9.1 23-AUG-1998
------------------

- MAJOR CHANGE : Review entirely the way
  to capture incoming messages. This will avoid
  some problems when running Linpopup with no
  root access privileges (like receive indefinitely
  the same message). And increase by the same occasion
  the speed of processing new messages.
 
- No more garbage in the main window status-bar.

- Added the "Reply" function, with automatic
  quoting of original message. ( Appears in the
  message menu and as a new toolbar's icon ).      
 
- Added the Edit menu in the main window,
  with "Select All"
       "Copy to clipboard"
  and  "Preferences" 
  sub-menus. 

- On the way of user customization,
  and the first step is the Toolbar Properties
  that can now be customized in the preferences window.
  (Preferences are stored in a .linpopuprc file created
  in the user home directory)  

- Modified some icons, principally to make them share
  the same 256  colors palette. 
  Added a set of 16 colors icons for users with 256 
  colors depth display. 16 colors icons may be enabled
  in the new "preferences" dialog box. 

- Added the "Unreachable Host" error message.

- The "Help"->"About Linpopup" dialog box was relooked.

- Changed the text of the default message displayed
  when there is no message. 

- Changed the label "Send" in the message
  menu by "New". BTW the function is the same.

- Clean-Up some code.

- The INSTALL file was ported to correct English
  by Mark Veinot. After he removed all spelling and
  grammar errors (not so many in fact),
  I added some new ones.

- Added the THANKS files in the distribution
  where are listed major contributors, bug
  reporters, and some others.

- Modified in consequence the Makefile,
  as some little other things in it.
