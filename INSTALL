LINPOPUP - A Linux enhanced port of Winpopup
============================================


(Please read ALL of this file as it gives important information
about the configuration and use of Linpopup.)


INSTALLATION
=============

NOTE : Linpopup was only tested under Linux, but it may run
under other Unices. Successful reports are welcome.


You *MUST* have root privileges to INSTALL LinPopUp
and edit the smb.conf as described in STEP #2.

But it's *NOT* necessary to have root privileges
to use LinPopUp. 



STEP #1 : Building Linpopup
---------------------------
( Only required if you have the source distribution.
  If you have the binary distribution you can jump to step #2)

>>> You need to have installed GTK version 1.2.0 or better <<<
- GTK can be found at : ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk 
- Look  for any information about GTK at : http://www.gtk.org
- To know what version of GTK you have installed:
   % gtk-config --version
- To install on ubuntu 18.04, try apt-get install the following packages:
   libgtk2.0-dev libxmu-headers libxmu-dev libcanberra-gtk-module

To build Linpopup:
`cd' to the directory containing the this file and type:
% ./configure
Note that on ubuntu 18.04, you may need to maually tweak the Makefile located in src:
add the following:
add LIBS = -lX11    (just after the LIBOBJS = line)
add FLAGS = -L /lib64      (if you are running the 64 bit version) just after the CFLAGS = -g -O2 line

Next, 'cd' into the src directory and type:
% make

This will start the compilation process. Note that gcc may report some
warnings. Don't worry about them. Only worry if gcc returns an error code.

At this step you can verify that a LinPopUp excutable have been created 
by typing :
% ls

You can even launch it (if X-Windows is running) by typing :
% ./LinPopUp
(at this stage you will only be able to send messages)



STEP #2 : Installing Linpopup
-----------------------------

Type :
% make install

Note that you can uninstall it at any moment by typing:
% make uninstall

(By default, LinPopUp will be installed to /usr/local/bin
 But if you got the RedHat or Debian Package, 
 it will be installed in /usr/bin ) 

Note that linpopup by default will store messages in the folder /usr/local/var/linpopup.
On modern ubuntu installations, you may need to create thsi folder. Be sure that linpopup
can write to it.


*IMPORTANT*
-----------
To be able to receive messages that are sent to you, you will need to
edit the smb.conf file (generally found in /etc/samba directory) and to add
this line to the [global settings] section:

message command =  sh -c '/usr/local/bin/LinPopUp "%f" "%m" %s; rm %s' &

PLEASE NOTE that "%f" is not the same thing as %f , '%f' or `%f`
and take care to enter "%f" "%m" %s exactly as shown above
You may change the path to where is located LinPopUp,
You may remove the rm %s command that follows the LinPopUp command,
BUT YOU MUST ENTER "%f" "%m" %s

You can verify that sh is installed on your system by entering:
which sh

(see the smb.conf man page regarding the importance of the "&" at the end of the line)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BTW, THE ONLY BAD THING THAT CAN HAPPEN TO YOU IF YOU ENTER A WRONG 
MESSAGE COMMAND IS THAT YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RECEIVE SOME 
(ONLY A FEW, IN FACT) OF THE MESSAGES THAT ARE SENT TO YOU. 
( See at STEP #4 to understand why )
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For more information about smb.conf and the message command you can type:
% man smb.conf



STEP #3 : running LinPopUp
--------------------------

>>> You need to have Samba installed  <<<
- Samba can be found at : ftp://ftp.samba.org
- Look for any Information about Samba at : http://www.samba.org

Run Linpopup like any other X-Windows program. No argument is required. 

But you can use the -min argument to start LinPopUp minimized

So a good idea is to add this line to your .Xclient or .xinitrc file :
LinPopUp -min &
But if you don't know what these files are, don't worry about it, it is
not necessary.



STEP #4 : understanding how it works (not necessary)
----------------------------------------------------

How LinPopUp sends message is very easy to understand :
It simply calls smbclient - which is a part of the Samba package - with
the -M argument telling it to whom and what message send.
(more info : % man smbclient)


Understanding how it receives messages is a bit more complicated :
When the Samba daemon receives a message it will execute
the message command specified in smb.conf :

/usr/local/bin/LinPopUp "%f" "%m" %s

where %f is the sender's name, %m the name of the sender's computer
and %s the name of a temp file containing the message text. 
 
When called in this way ( with 3 arguments ) LinPopUp will start,
( or a new session will be launched if it is already running )
store the message, and immediately exit.
Because it will not attempt to use any X-Windows display, it can do
everything that it has to do ( store the message ) even
when X-Windows is not running. This is why you can receive
messages even if X-Windows is not actually working.



WHY PUTTING %f and %m BETWEEN "" IS IMPORTANT?
----------------------------------------------
In brief: because spaces that can be in the sender's name (%f)
or in the sender's machine name (%m) are interpreted as additional
arguments.

Suppose that JOHN DOE is working on MY COMPUTER and sends you
a message,

If the message command in smb.conf is : 
    LinPopUp %f %m %s
LinPopUp will be launched like this : 
    LinPopUp JOHN DOE MY COMPUTER message_filename
and will stupidly believe that JOHN is the sender, 
DOE the sender's computer name, MY is the file containing the message text. 
And because the file MY doesn't exist, it will not deliver any message.


But if the message command in smb.conf is : 
    LinPopUp "%f" "%m" %s
LinPopUp will be launched like this : 
    LinPopUp "JOHN DOE" "MY COMPUTER" message_filename
and will know that JOHN DOE is the sender, MY COMPUTER is the sender's 
computer name, message_filename is the file containing the message text. 
And because this file exist, will deliver you the right message.


Because the name of the file containing the message text (%s)
never contains space, it is not necessary to put %s between "".
