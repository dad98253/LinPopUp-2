- Display the message text length in the status bar,
  or remove it?

- Look if it's possible to send a msg to a workgroup...


Lay Out [ Hein-Jan Leliveld, Holland ]
--------------------------------------
If I send a message using the keyboard I type in first the name of the
person, and then I push the tab button... but than I go to the send button
instead to the message dialog!! a much more logical tab configuration is
first name bar, then message dialog and then the send bar. (alt-tab doesn't
work either, because you first go to the bottom scrollbar)


Text Mode [ Gianni Rondinini, Italy ]
-------------------------------------
it would be nice to be able to send and receive with a --nice-- package
winpopup messages with the text mode


Play sound when a message is received ? [ Hein-Jan Leliveld, Holland ]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A wav file and/or a speaker beep (for those who play mp3s.....)
