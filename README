to communicate between Linux computers that run Samba). 

Note that LinPopUp is not only a port, 
as it includes several enhanced features like : 

       Doesn't need to always run :

       In fact, the only way to miss a message that was sent to you is 
       to have your computer turned off. 

       Messages are kept from session to session.
       You will always retrieve a message that was sent to you, 
       ... if you have not deleted it.

       And other features like :
       Possibility to reply to a message, clipboard cut & past, etc.
